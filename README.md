# .dotfiles

Other people have thought about dotfiles, so work with what they've done until
it doesn't work for you. My approach is a mix of those of [holman][] and
[mattiasbynes][]. If you're running OS X, you should have a look at [this OS X
configuration script][osx].  

Check out [dotfiles.github.io][dotfiles] for a comprehensive list of dotfile
approaches.
